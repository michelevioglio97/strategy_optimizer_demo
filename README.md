# strategy_optimizer_demo
Repository for strategy optimizer demo to be deployed on Streamlit
There is a version of the python file and the excel q-matrix which is lighter than the original
This application is deployed on streamlit at the link: https://strategyoptimizerdemo-pwibzl5lt8duj3evtxh2qs.streamlit.app/
The link will periodically expire, so it will be necessary to deploy it again when it's needed, by going to the streamlit site, accessing with Github account and recalling this repo
